            <p>Hi! My name is Karina RodrÃ­guez and I am from Mexico City. I love painting, art digital, and making craft hands. Fifteen years ago I got a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in my country. The university where I studied for my degree was founded by Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and David Alfaro Siqueiros.
                I decided to enroll in Pathway because I only wanted to improve my English but when I started it, I loved the program then I chose to take  TEFL and Graphic Design certificates.</p>
